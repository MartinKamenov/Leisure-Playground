                    New York Times bestselling author and producer of the FOX television hit Bones—returns with the thirteenth
                    riveting novel featuring forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan. John Lowery was declared dead
                    in 1968—the victim of a Huey crash in Vietnam, his body buried long ago in North Carolina. Four decades
                    later, Temperance Brennan is called to the scene of a drowning in Hemmingford, Quebec. The victim appears
                    to have died while in the midst of a bizarre sexual practice. The corpse is later identified as John
                    Lowery. But how could Lowery have died twice, and how did an American soldier end up in Canada? Amazon
                    Link! P.S. Bones is one of my most favorite shows EVEREVEREVER! Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins Against
                    all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice. But now that she’s made it out of the
                    bloody arena alive, she’s still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they
                    think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And what’s worse, President Snow has made it clear that no
                    one else is safe either. Not Katniss’s family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful
                    and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne Collins’s groundbreaking The Hunger Games trilogy
                    promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year. Amazon link! Bearers of the Black Staff
                    (Legends of Shannara) by Terry Brooks For more than three decades, New York Times bestselling author
                    Terry Brooks has ruled the epic fantasy realm with his legendary Shannara series. With each new novel
                    the mythos has deepened, ever more fascinating characters have arisen, and increasingly breathtaking
                    vistas of magical adventure have emerged. Now the evolution of one of imaginative fiction’s most beloved
                    worlds continues in the first book of the new series Legends of Shannara: Bearers of the Black Staff.
                    Five hundred years have passed since the devastating demon-led war that tore apart the United States,
                    leaving nothing but scorched and poisoned ruins, and nearly exterminating humankind. Those who escaped
                    the carnage and blight were led to sanctuary by the boy savior known as the Hawk—the gypsy morph. In
                    an idyllic valley, its borders warded by powerful magic against the horrors beyond, humans, elves, and
                    mutants alike found a place they believed would be their home forever. But after five centuries, the
                    unimaginable has come to pass: The cocoon of protective magic surrounding the valley has vanished. When
                    Sider Ament, the only surviving descendant of the Knights of the Word, detects unknown predators stalking
                    the valley, he fears the worst. And when Panterra Qu and Prue Liss, expert Trackers from the human village
                    of Glensk Wood, find two of their own gruesomely killed, there can be no doubt: The once safe haven of
                    generations has been laid bare and made vulnerable to whatever still lurks in the wasteland of the outside
                    world. Together, Ament, the two young Trackers, and a daring Elf princess race to spread word of the
                    encroaching danger—and spearhead plans to defend their ancestral home. But suspicion and hostility among
                    their countrymen threaten to doom their efforts from within—while beyond the breached borders, a ruthless
                    Troll army masses for invasion. And in the thick of it all, the last wielder of the black staff and its
                    awesome magic must find a successor to carry on the fight against the cresting new wave of evil. Amazon
                    Link! Exploring Happineess: From Aristotle to Brain Science by Sissela Bok In this smart and timely book,
                    the distinguished moral philosopher Sissela Bok ponders the nature of happiness and its place in philosophical
                    thinking and writing throughout the ages. With nuance and elegance, Bok explores notions of happiness
                    – from Greek philosophers to Desmond Tutu, Charles Darwin, Iris Murdoch, and the Dalai Lama – as well
                    as the latest theories advanced by psychologists, economists, geneticists, and neuroscientists. Eschewing
                    abstract theorizing, Bok weaves in a wealth of firsthand observations about happiness from ordinary people
                    as well as renowned figures. This may well be the most complete picture of happiness yet. This book is
                    also a clarion call to think clearly and sensitively about happiness. Bringing together very different
                    disciplines provides Bok with a unique opportunity to consider the role of happiness in wider questions
                    of how we should lead our lives and treat one another – concerns that don’t often figure in today’s happiness
                    equation. How should we pursue, weigh, value, or limit our own happiness, or that of others, now and
                    in the future? Compelling and perceptive, Exploring Happiness shines a welcome new light on the heart
                    of the human condition. Amazon Link!
